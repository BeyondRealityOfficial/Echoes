# Echoes
 This is the official Archive for the "Echoes" game made by Beyond Reality Studios
 if you are interested in the pre Unreal Engine stuff you can go into the [Old_Stuff] folder and
 check some old unity versions!
 
 State of the Game: Early Development, Switched from unity to Unreal Engine due to performance problems

 Install: Just put the Versions folder and the license (optional) in your local games or program files folder and
          search for the latest version (everytime it is the highest number) and hit Game_run.bat

 Note: The development builds (Espacially the very first ones) may not run on your machine due to
       the abscence of the required development libraries! Development builds are marked with "dev_"
